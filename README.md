Contains few bash scripts that I like to play around with.


ScalablePingCheck.sh:
The script pings the websites and lists RTT. To add more websites, add URLs in line 9. To specify interval, add seconds to sleep command on line 30. To specify iterations, change values on line 4 and 23(currently it's 3) 

Pattern.sh:
Draws a Rhombus on screen 

Encrypt.sh:
Encrypts a file using passphrase. Deletes original thereafter
